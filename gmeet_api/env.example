# ============================================
# Google Meet API - Environment Variables
# ============================================
# These environment variables are for the Google Meet API module
# Add them to your AWS App Runner configuration or .env file
# Never commit .env to version control!

# ============================================
# Environment
# ============================================
# Set to "development" or "production"
# - "development": Allows OAuth over HTTP (for local testing)
# - "production": Requires HTTPS for OAuth (default behavior)
ENVIRONMENT=development

# ============================================
# Google OAuth Configuration
# ============================================
# OAuth callback URL - where Google redirects after authorization
# For local development: http://localhost:8030/gmeet/auth/callback
# For production: https://your-domain.com/gmeet/auth/callback
# Replace 'your-domain.com' with your actual AWS App Runner domain
GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8030/gmeet/auth/callback

# ============================================
# Frontend Redirect URLs (Optional)
# ============================================
# If these are NOT set, the API will return JSON responses instead of redirecting
# If these ARE set, the API will redirect to these URLs after OAuth completion

# Success page - where to redirect after successful OAuth
# Example: https://yourapp.com/counsellor/welcome
FRONTEND_COUNSELLOR_SUCCESS_URL=

# Error page - where to redirect on OAuth failure
# Example: https://yourapp.com/counsellor/error
FRONTEND_COUNSELLOR_ERROR_URL=

# ============================================
# Notes
# ============================================
# 1. Place your Google OAuth credentials.json file in the Nucleotide-website_v11 root directory
# 2. DATABASE_URL is already configured in the main app - no need to set it here
# 3. PORT is hardcoded to 8030 in the dockerfile - do not set PORT as an environment variable
# 4. CORS is hardcoded to allow all origins - no configuration needed
# 5. Set FRONTEND_COUNSELLOR_SUCCESS_URL and FRONTEND_COUNSELLOR_ERROR_URL
#    if you want redirects instead of JSON responses
# 6. Update GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI to match your deployment URL
